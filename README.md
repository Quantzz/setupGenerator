# setupGenerator
A library for personal use that generates the base folders and files i need when starting a new larger python project.
I wrote this way back, when I didn't know about the various cookie-cutter repos that are more powerful. 

# How To
Run core.py from the commandline with the type of license and project name as arguments. 

Example:
`python3 ~/setupGenerator/core.py -l="mit" -p="projectname" -o="This Is My Name" -y="2018"`
